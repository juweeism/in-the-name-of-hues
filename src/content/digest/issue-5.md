##### websites with signs of life

![See You Again by Kids Club website](../../assets/img/kids-club.png)
1. An interactive promotional website for a book titled [See You Again by Kids Club](https://kidsclub.hatopress.net). This website will walk you through a 360 tour of a small bar and the toys, the stories, the journey it holds of its owner. 
2. A website that lets you gift someone a custom song for fun just because. Try out [sentyouasong](https://sentyouasong.com), created by Jane Ling. Sent songs to a few friends with it.
3. [I Miss my Cafe](https://imissmycafe.com) is a virtual cafe where you could enjoy the whole cafe experience with an adjustable ambiance you could tweak to match your mood.

##### font foundries 

1. [Notyourtype](https://notyourtype.nl/typefaces/) is a foundry for fun experimental fonts. Hands down the best resource if you enjoy hand written and freeform fonts. 
2. [Typotheque](https://typotheque.genderfluid.space/fr) is a foundry for silly and fancy and elegant fonts. Open Licesnse. Beware, the website is in french. Thanks [nara](https://x.com/0bnara) for your contribution.
3. [Velvetyne](https://www.velvetyne.fr) is a collective that believes in fonts with "high poetic, aesthetic, or technical value." 

There's more but it's your turn now I am handing you the shovel so you could dig a deeper hole on your own. Have fun. [Your starting point is here.](https://www.are.na/lauren-gallagher-1503862652/resource-type-foundries-d-3dp47gb08)

##### lazy reading

1. [Hunting the Nearly Invisible Personal Website](https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/personal-website-hunting.html). Personal websites are not a lost art (yet). Contains links to various blogrolls. Speaking of blogrolls, you could check out [mine here](https://juw.ee/blogroll).
2. [How to run a shadow library](https://annas-archive.li/blog/how-to-run-a-shadow-library.html) or how the operations at Anna's Archive work. I've always wondered how they get away with it. Cloudflare mentioned!
3. [The hardest working font in Manhattan](https://aresluna.org/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/)is called a *Gorton* and is older than Gill Sans or Futura. Thank you [snats](https://snats.xyz) for sharing this.

##### post notes
