Hello internet! I hope everyone had a lovely Sunday. Link hoarding from now on will be accompanied by Readwise Reader, an app I use to hyper organize blogs, rss, and the likes for later ogling. This post is NOT sponsored by Readwise (although i wish it was.)

##### üë• software collectives to keep an eye on
1. [Ink and Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/) is reimagining personal computing and is pushing for the [local first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) software movement.
1. [Hundred Rabbits](https://100r.co/site/home.html) is a collective of artist-programmers on a sailboat building small, playful, open source, and sustainable software.
1. [voidzero](https://voidzero.dev/) is crafting next generation toolings for the JavaScript ecosystem (team behind Vite and VItest)
1. [Lavender Software](https://lavender.software/) makes software that is lavender and i think that's beautiful.

##### ‚úâÔ∏è letters on open source
1. [How to make your open source popular](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-make-your-open-source-popular), from the author of PostCSS and Autoprefixes.
1. [charm.sh](https://charm.sh) shares their journey to 100k stars on github in the article [This is How We Do it](https://charm.sh/blog/100k/)

##### ü´∂ some personal picks
![milk cartons on a shelf with a sticky note](https://brodzinski.com/wp-content/uploads/kanban-1-2048x1161.jpg)
1. [Milk Kanban](http://brodzinski.com/2025/03/milk-kanban.html)! visual cues make the perfect kanban system.
1. [If you don't tinker, you don't have taste](https://seated.ro/blog/tinkering-a-lost-art) by [ronin](https://x.com/seatedro). If you're not feeding your sense of taste by trying things out all the time, what are you even doing?
1. [maybe this is where we need to stop](https://yvas.me/blogs/maybe-this-is-where-we-need-to-stop/), a wonderful rant by Savy. If you read the whole thing, maybe check out [llm struggles](https://www.are.na/ju-wee/llm-struggles) via arena.
