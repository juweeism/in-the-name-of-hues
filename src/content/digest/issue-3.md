1. [Text is UI](https://thomasbyttebier.be/blog/the-best-ui-typeface-goes-unnoticed). This neat blog post tells you everything you need to know before choosing the best font for your next project.
1. The web is 95% typography therefore we should treat text as interface. [The web is all about typoraphy, period.](https://ia.net/topics/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period)

1. [Pelata Pieces](https://www.pelatapieces.com/) is a collection of heirloom-quality wooden games and instruments. Snatched it for its beautiful font choice.
1. and of course, the [safont webring](https://xandra.cc/safonts/#about), short for 'font savant'. safont... savant... get it?

ðŸ’¬ Decorating this website took 2 days of my divided attention, more or less. More links and longer content to expect on the next few updates as I sort things out. I hid an easter egg somewhere good luck finding it.
